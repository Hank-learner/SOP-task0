A repository for learning git

Git is a Version Control System (VCS). Version Control Systems are a category of software tools that help to manage changes to a code over time. VCS keeps track of every change to the code. 

Basically, using a VCS generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover them. Guess that’s motivation enough to learn Git.

Task:

We are faced with the most important question of the century- Which came first: the chicken or the egg? And now, we want your help to resolve this question.

Tell us your answer by following the steps below:

* Fork the repo and then Clone this common github repo from your account to your local system.

* Create a branch named fullname(your fullname) without any spaces use _ instead of spaces if necessary.

* In your branch, create a file named log.txt. In this file, you will inventory all the commands you’ve used to complete this task with a short description of each onw by one in order.

* Also create two branches 1 and 2 with different names locally from your fullname branch. In 1, give a one word answer to the question posed above in log.txt file. In the other (2), explain why you decided on that answer in the log.txt file.

* Now merge the two branches into fullname branch one by one. Got conflicts? Resolve them manually. Then run Git merge again

* When you’re ready, pull the most recent changes from the repo. Then, commit your changes and create a pull request.

* Once your pull request is accepted, fetch and pull the changes to the repo. In your mentor’s branch (master), push your log.txt file. Remember to rename it fullname_log.txt (not creating new file, renaming it).

* Create another pull request.

For people without computer access:

* Read up on resources and find out all the commands that will be required to complete the above task.

* Make a proper documentation about all necessary commands (with explanations) in a doc. Also cover all possible errors and conflicts that may arise.

* Submit it to your mentor. Your mentor may quiz you on your git knowledge, so please refrain from copying.
