Answer:"Egg"

Explaination:
	Basically, many, many moons ago there was a chicken-like bird.
It was genetically close to a chicken but wasn't a full-blown chicken yet. 
It is called a proto-chicken. 
So proto-hen laid an egg, and proto-rooster fertilized it. 
But when the genes from ma and pa almost-chicken fused, 
they combined in a new way, creating a mutation that accidentally made the baby different from its parents. 
Although it would take millennia for the difference to be noticed, 
that egg was different enough to become the official progenitor of a new species, now known as... the chicken! 
So in a nutshell (or an eggshell, if you like), two birds that weren't really chickens created a chicken egg, 
and hence, The egg came first, and then it hatched a chicken.
